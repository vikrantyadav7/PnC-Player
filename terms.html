All waivers must be made in writing and the failure of You or PNCplayer to enforce any right or provision in a Contract or in these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver on one occasion shall not imply or constitute a waiver on any other occasion. PNCplayer shall not be responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performing any of its obligations under a Contract or these Terms of Service to the extent that such a failure or delay results from force majeure causes beyond its control, such as acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the government in its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, freight embargoes, strikes, civil commotion, or the like. You may not transfer or assign these Terms of Service or any rights or obligations hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of PNCplayer and any such assignment shall be null and void from the beginning. The Contract(s), including without limitation these Terms of Service, shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon PNCplayer’s or Your respective permitted successors and assigns.</p></div></article></body></html>
